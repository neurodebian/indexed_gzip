Description: fast random access of gzip files in Python
 Drop-in replacement `IndexedGzipFile` for the built-in Python `gzip.GzipFile`
 class that does not need to start decompressing from the beginning of the
 file when for every `seek()`. It gets around this performance limitation by
 building an index, which contains *seek points*, mappings between
 corresponding locations in the compressed and uncompressed data streams. Each
 seek point is accompanied by a chunk (32KB) of uncompressed data which is
 used to initialise the decompression algorithm, allowing to start reading
 from any seek point. If the index is built with a seek point spacing of 1MB,
 only 512KB (on average) of data have to be decompressed to read from any
 location in the file.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 module.
